Initial conclusions about reproducibility of results

First:
- no comparison for Diabetes, Amenia [no access to dataset]
- no comparison (yet) for CNN, Tweets (not finished yet)

Method:
- rerun once

CONCLUSIONS, SORTED BY METRIC

Accuracy:
- overall results look similar
- notable differences found for:
  - Yelp: conicity Ortho
  - Babi1: conicity LSTM
  - Babi2: differences in accuracy and conicity, for LSTM, Diversity and Ortho
  - Babi3: differences in accuracy and conicity for LSTM, and to a lesser degree in accuracy for Diversity and Ortho
  
CONCLUSIONS, SORTED BY MODEL

SST: Very similar results
- only notable difference: mean attention for rationales in LSTM
