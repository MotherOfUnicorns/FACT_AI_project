# Objective

To investigate reproducibility of papers accepted for publication at top conferences by inviting members of the community at large to select a paper, and verify the empirical results and claims in the paper by reproducing the computational experiments, either via a new implementation or using code/data or other information provided by the authors.

# Steps

Step 1: registration/claim the paper
- ‘Our’ paper has not been claimed yet
- There is no deadline for registration
- Expect to complete the following information when you submit your claim:
    * University / Institution (public)
    * Reproducibility Plan: We expect you to write a short proposal (500 words max) of your reproducibility plan of action for the selected paper - see the  Task Description for more details. In this proposal, write concisely how you would approach the problem. This proposal essentially helps to narrow down your deliverables regarding the challenge. This proposal will not be made public, neither will it be used in our reviews.

Step 2: write the paper

- To write the report, you will use the MLRC template:https://www.overleaf.com/project/5f4e72de7681920001b208f9. The objective of the report is to explain the results you obtained as well as the process behind the implementation. Your report should be no more than 8 pages long (excluding references).

# Deadlines

- If you would like to receive feedback on an early draft of yourreport, you can email it to your TA by23:59 on 20 January. 
- FINAL: Late submission deadline (to be considered for peer review) : January 29th, 2021 (11:59PM PDT)
